# UMD Marketplace - CMSC434 Project
A website that allows a University of Maryland student to sell and buy items easily from each other. This is a React website high fidelity prototype made for CMSC434 [Introduction to Human-Computer Interaction]. 

The three primary tasks that this prototype supports are creating a new listing, an inbox for communicating between buyers and sellers, and navigating and searching for a product. Our team members include Amartya Banerjee, Jizhen Wang, Lydia Hu, Josh Nail, and William Thomas. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
